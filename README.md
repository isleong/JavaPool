JavaPool
========

Originally an applet but converted to Android for fun. Wanted to see how much work was involved. Original code is from the JavaPool example in the book Java Game Programming by Doug Bell and Wayne Holder. They wrote the code with AWT. I added sound just for fun. The book is over 15 years old but I liked their examples and wanted to give another lease on life to them.
